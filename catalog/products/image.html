<h1>Products :: Image</h1>
<h2>Image tab</h2>
<p>The images tags let the administrator add additional product images to the product page. The main image was already uploaded in the <a href="http://docs.opencart.com/products-data">Data </a>tab of Products, so keep in mind these images will be included below that main image on the product page.</p>
<p><img src="http://docs.opencart.com/userfiles/1869/2899/ckfinder/images/documentation/adding%20main%20product%20images.png" alt="adding main product images" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>
<p>You may click &quot;Add Image&quot;, then &quot;Browse&quot; to select an image from the <a href="http://docs.opencart.com/image-manager">Image manager</a>. Assign a number for sorting order. &quot;1&quot; will make it the first additional image, while every descending sorting number will follow it. The image above is an example from a product page in the store front. The large main image was added in the <a href="http://docs.opencart.com/products-data">Data</a> tab. The images above were added in the &quot;Image&quot; tab, with the farthest top left assigned as 1, and the following images assigned a lower priority.</p>
