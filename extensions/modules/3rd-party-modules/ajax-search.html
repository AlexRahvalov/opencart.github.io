<h1>AJAX Search</h1>
<h2>AJAX Search</h2>
<p>Your store&#39;s search tool can be a powerful way to connect your customer to your store&#39;s products. With the use of the<a href="http://opencart.hostjars.com/ajax-search"> AJAX Search</a> module by <a href="http://opencart.hostjars.com/">HostJars</a>, your customer will find the products they need faster and more efficiently. The ease in which the customer can find that product will result in higher conversion rates and ultimately more sales.</p>
<p>When a customer types into your OpenCart store&#39;s search box, they will need to know at least part of the correct name of your product to find it. OpenCart&#39;s search tool will match the words entered to any part of the product name. If the customer doesn&#39;t know the name of the exact product they want, or is merely browsing for similar products, it will be more difficult for them to find the right product for them. As a result, there will be less of a chance that this customer will buy a product from your store.</p>
<p><a href="http://opencart.hostjars.com/ajax-search">AJAX Search</a> provides an auto-complete function when the customer uses your search box. This function starts whenever your customer begins typing into the search box. As seen in the screenshot below, when the customer starts typing &quot;cat&quot;, 4 products containing &quot;cat&quot; in their name will be displayed below the search box. This gives the customer a range of products containing what they need at their fingertips.</p>

These factors will help the customer quickly pick a product to their liking, at the same time exposing them to the other products in your store.</p>
<p>Let your customers get to their products quickly and discover more products in your store with the <a href="http://opencart.hostjars.com/ajax-search">AJAX Search</a> module today.</p>
