<h1>Cloud Cache CDN</h1>
<h2>Cloud Cache Content Delivery Network (CDN)</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://opencart.hostjars.com/opencart-cdn">CloudCache CDN module</a> is a powerful 3rd party module that dramatically increases the efficiency and performance of your OpenCart store. Many e-commerce stores have turned to CDNs to make sure the content of their stores reaches their customer base fast, no matter where they are located. CDN&#39;s can reach these customers because they are made of a network of powerful servers across the globe. This results in a quicker response time than what your store&#39;s server can deliver from its single location.</p>
<p>High performance will have a beneficial effect in improving your store&#39;s customer conversion rates. A content delivery network ensures that your customer won&#39;t have to sit through long page loading times before viewing your store&#39;s products. Oftentimes the customer will not wait for the page to load if it takes too long, and will ultimately leave your store&#39;s site before even getting a chance to view your product. The CDN will help your store be prepared for traffic spikes and server crashes, bringing your products to your customers in a fast, dependable manner. Therefore, using a content delivery network becomes a must for e-commerce stores, especially those with a large product load.</p>
