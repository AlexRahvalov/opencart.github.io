<h1>Image upload</h1>
<h2>Image upload</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://docs.opencart.com/Image-manager">image and file manager</a> in OpenCart can often cause users grief. Noting a few things can greatly reduce difficulty:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure your <a href="http://docs.opencart.com/Image-upload">system settings</a> are set to not display errors. PHP errors in JSON responses required by the image manager break the JSON and therefore the image upload.</li>
  <li>Make sure your files are valid images of appropriate format (animated gif files are not supported).</li>
</ul>
