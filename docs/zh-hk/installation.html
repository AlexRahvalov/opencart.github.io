<h1>Installation</h1>
<h2>安裝OpenCart系統</h2>
<p>本指引將說明如何成功安裝與卸載OpenCart系統。</p>


<h2>下載並解壓縮OpenCart檔案</h2>
<p>OpenCart（v.3.0.2.0）的最新版本可以從<a href="https://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=cms/download">OpenCart網站</a>下載（推薦一般用家）或直接從<a href="https://github.com/opencart/opencart">github 平台</a>下載（推薦網頁開發人員）。下載頁面更提供較舊版本的OpenCart方便網頁開發人員用。 按下"DOWNLOAD NOW" 按建，3.0.2.0版本的zip壓縮檔會直接下載到您的電腦。3.0.2.0版本的檔案對應名稱為"3.0.2.0-OpenCart.zip”。</p>
<p>如欲下載其他版本，請按"Release notes" 或 "previous releases"，查找您所需要的版本並下載。</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="image/opencart-site-download.png" alt="OpenCart Official Site - Download" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i> 如果您的電腦上沒有可以從zip檔案中提取文件的程序，<a href=”https://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&L=0”>WinRar</a>提供免費下載。解壓縮zip檔案將會解壓縮OpenCart檔案，以便可以通過網頁伺服器瀏覽相關檔案。</div>
<p>解壓縮文件後，裡面會包含：</p>
<ul>
  <li>"upload" 文件夾</li>
  <li>"license.txt" 文字檔</li>
  <li>"readme.txt" 文字檔</li>
</ul>
<p>"upload" 包含將OpenCart上傳到網頁伺服器所需的所有文件。"license.txt" 裡包含有關在您的網站上使用OpenCart系統的許可協議。"readme.txt" 檔提供了OpenCart網站上當前安裝和升級說明的連結。準備就緒後，您可以將壓縮檔中的檔案儲存到電腦上您所選的位置。</p>

<h2>上傳OpenCart</h2>
<p>現在，您要先準備網頁寄存空間以及文件傳輸協議(FTP) 程式並將 "upload" 內的所有檔案上傳至網頁伺服器內。</p>

<h3>Installing and configuring the FTP client</h3>
<p>We recommend using Filezilla as your FTP client. Filezilla is a free FTP client that will transfer the OpenCart files to any web server specified. The FileZilla client (not the server) can be downloaded from <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/">http://filezilla-project.org/</a> and installed onto a computer.</p>
<p>When you open Filezilla you should see your computer&#39;s file directory on the left side. The next step is to locate where you saved the uncompressed OpenCart archive and click on the &quot;upload&quot; folder, and the files should appear below it. The directory needs to be left open as we continue. The right hand side is blank at the moment because the target website hasn&#39;t been connected to. When connected it will display the file directory of the web server.</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="image/filezilla-disconnect.png" alt="filezilla disconnect" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>
<p>Before we continue, we need to make sure that you have the following information about your website:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the host name</li>
  <li>username</li>
  <li>password</li>
</ul>
<p>This information can be obtained by contacting your hosting provider.</p>
<h3>Connecting to the Site Manager</h3>
<p>Under the &ldquo;File&rdquo; menu, &ldquo;Site Manager&rdquo; should be opened in Filezilla. A window will pop up with the General tab open. You should fill in the information gathered above regarding hosting information, and press &ldquo;Connect&rdquo;. The right &ldquo;Remote Site&rdquo; side will now display the file directory of your website.</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="image/filezilla%20site%20manager.png" alt="filezilla site manager" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>
<h3>Uploading OpenCart&#39;s files</h3>
<p>If you haven&#39;t already located the OpenCart upload folder on the left side, you need to do so now and keep it open. In the Remote Site directory (right side), you need to open the folder that the OpenCart shop will be located in. The location of shop varies based on whether the you want the shop to be seen on the main page, a sub-folder, a subdomain, etc. If you want to make OpenCart the main page, you would need to upload files to the root folder of their website.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Be aware that some hosting services require public files to be upload to a public directory, such as public_html, if they are to be visible on the website. You should check with your hosting provider to see where you can upload public files. </div>
<p>Once the location of the OpenCart shop has been determined, all the content within the &ldquo;upload&rdquo; folder on the computer&#39;s (left) side of Filezilla must be selected, right-clicked, and uploaded. Uploading all the files might take a few minutes on the FTP client.</p>
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i> If you want the shop to be on the main page, for example www.shopnow.com, you must upload the contents of the &ldquo;upload&rdquo; folder, but not the &ldquo;upload&rdquo; folder itself. Including the &ldquo;upload&rdquo; folder will create a sub-folder, making the shop available only on www.shopnow.com/upload.</div>
<p>After Filezilla finishes uploading the files to the location specified, you should see the same files on both the left side(computer) and on the right side (the website); as seen in the screenshot below:</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="image/filezilla-file-transfer.png" alt="filezilla file transfer-png" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>
<p>The Filezilla window should look similar to the above image (minus some directory details). This means that the OpenCart files were successfully transferred the target site. The site now contains the files necessary to setup an OpenCart shop.</p>

<h2>cPanel</h2>
<p>If your Web Server provider is using cPanel, you can try with this method without FileZilla.</p>
<p>Go to the “Upload” folder and select all the files inside and zip it to a new zip file. Login your cPanel and click the “File Manager” to open a new tag in the browser. Upload the new zip file in your target path, it should be inside the public_html folder. After that you can right click the zip file and select “Extract" button and done.</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="image/cpanel-file-manager.png" alt="cPanel File Manager" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>

<h2>Creating a database for the shop</h2>
<p>The next step is to create a database on the MySQL server for OpenCart to store a shop&#39;s data on. You should log into the site&rsquo;s control panel and locate MySQL Databases. Using MySQL Databases, you can create a new database by entering a database name and a username/password to access this database. The user that was just created needs to be added to the database, along with enabling all of the necessary permissions. We will use this database information later when we are configuring OpenCart using the auto-installer.</p>
<h2>Launch the auto-installer</h2>
<p>With a new database freshly created, we are now ready to install OpenCart directly onto a website. You should open up a web browser and enter in the web address of where they uploaded OpenCart. If the &quot;install&quot; folder in &quot;upload&quot; was uploaded correctly, you should be automatically greeted by the following page:</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="image/opencart-step1.png" alt="opencart step1" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>
<p>This page is the installation page. The following steps will help you complete the installation process for OpenCart.</p>
<h3>Step 1. License</h3>
<p>You may read through the license, check &quot;I agree to the license&quot;, and press &ldquo;Continue&rdquo;.</p>
<h3>Step 2. Pre-Installation</h3>
<p>This step checks to see if the web server has the technical requirements and correct permissions to setup OpenCart properly. If red marks are visible on #1 or #2, you need to make sure that these components are properly installed onto the web server. You should contact your hosting service if there are any issues with this. If there are red marks on #3 or #4, there might have been an issue with uploading the files using the FTP client. If everything is configured correctly and green marks are visible (as seen below), you may press &quot;Continue&quot;.</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="image/opencart-step2.png" alt="opencart step2" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> As of version 2.3.0.2, the following files need to be renamed to continue to Step 3:
  <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; config-dist.php to config.php</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; admin/config-dist.php to config.php</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h3>Step 3. Configuration</h3>
<p>You need to fill in the spaces below #1 by adding the database connection details (username/password, database name) established when you created the store&#39;s database using MySQL Databases. Under #2, you should create a new username and password for administration access to the OpenCart shop. When finished, you may press &quot;Continue&quot;.</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="image/opencart-step3.png" alt="opencart step3" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>
<h2>Completing the installation</h2>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Step 4. Finished</h3>
<p>Now that installation is complete, the &quot;install&quot; folder is no longer required. You should delete the &ldquo;install&rdquo; folder in the Remote Site section of Filezilla for security reasons. You now have the option to browse the frontend of your shop or choose to log into the administration side.</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="image/opencart-step4.png" alt="opencart step4" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>
<p>After the install, you should make the necessary steps towards improving the security of your server and OpenCart store directory. These steps are detailed in <a href="administration/security/">Basic security practices</a>.</p>
<h2>Installing vQmod</h2>
<p>vQmod for OpenCart lets you add modules to your store without modifying the core OpenCart code. See vQmod for more information on how to download and install <a href="administration/vqmod/">vQmod </a>for your store.</p>
<h2>Updating OpenCart</h2>
<p>OpenCart releases new versions from time to time with updated features and bug fixes. To learn how to update a store from an earlier version of OpenCart, visit <a href="upgrading/">Updating OpenCart</a>.</p>
<h2>Uninstalling OpenCart</h2>
<p>Uninstalling OpenCart is a quick and simple process.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Delete the files/folders in the location you uploaded them to in Filezilla. &nbsp;</li>
  <li>Delete the OpenCart database from MySQL Databases or phpMyAdmin.</li>
</ol>
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Once OpenCart is uninstalled, all product and customer information will be lost. You can save a backup database file in case you want to reinstall OpenCart at a later time. See <a href="system/backup/">Backup/Restore</a> for more information.</div>
