<h1>橫額</h1>

<p>這裡的橫額是指店面首頁中的巨大橫額，可以加上連結使其與網站內外進行連結。橫額的主要功用是可以吸引顧客的眼睛，並引導他們到設定好的頁面或產品資料中。如要編輯所有橫額項目可從管理者介面前往 <strong>設計(Design)</strong> 選單的 <strong>橫額(Banner)</strong>頁面。</p>


<h3>模組與橫額</h3>
<p>The <a href="zh-hk/extension/module/">Modules </a>section uses banners for two modules: Carousel and Banners. The Banners section lets you customize what page layout the banner will be included, and its position. The Carousel module acts like a slideshow, or carousel. The customer can click an arrow to look through a range of product images.</p>
<p>If you want to create a new carousel banner displaying all the manufacturer logos, you need to go to System&gt;Design&gt;Banners, and click &quot;Insert&quot;. After coming up with a banner name for later reference, you would to click &quot;Add Banner&quot; to add a new icon to the banner. The following fields are needed to add a new icon to the banner:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tr>
    <th width="30%">Title</th>
    <td width="*">滑鼠指向橫額時，會顯示此標題</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Link</th>
    <td>連結到指定頁面</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Image</th>
    <td>透過系統的圖片管理可以選擇顯示的橫額圖片</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Sort</th>
    <td>設定橫額的顯示次序</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class="text-center"><img src="image/design%20layout%20carousel.png" alt="add route page" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>
<p>You may add as many banners to the banner as necessary. Under <a href="zh-hk/extension/module/">Modules</a>, you can edit the Carousel to display the &quot;Manufacturers Banner&quot;. The image below is the screenshot of the home page after the Carousel was assigned the Manufacturers banner. All the manufacturer logos that were added to the Manufacturers banner in the administration can be scrolled through in the store front.</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="image/system-design-banner.png" alt="Carousel frond end" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>
<p>It its a advised that you test the links by clicking on the images on the banner. If the clicks do not direct the user to the manufacturer location, double check to see if the page address was typed in correctly in the administration.</p>
