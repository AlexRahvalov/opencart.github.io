<h1>產品類別概覽</h1>

<h2>產品類別</h2>
<p>於預設主題而言，主要類別(Parent Categories)會於網頁的頂部以及產品頁面的左側空間顯示出來。分類功能主要是將類同的產品細分，這好讓顧客可以更容易找到他們所需的東西。同時間店內的產品做好分類後，顧客即使要作出資訊及數據上的比較時也可以容易看出差別而更快速作出決定。</p>
<p>每當新增一款產品時，使用者都必須為產品載入其類別，所以必須先建立了產品類別才能加入產品到店內，這樣的流程可以減少產品資料變得混亂以及減少不必要的重覆編輯動作。</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  <i class="far fa-exclamation-circle"></i>
  OpenCart商店中的產品都必須點選所屬的類別，若果沒有被分類，產品會無法於前台任何類別中顯示。除非於產品搜索中輸入關鍵字或從品牌選項中尋找。
</div>

<p>在管理者介面中點擊左側<strong>目錄 (Catalog)</strong>展開次目錄，進入產品類別的清單頁面可以看見每項分類名稱，如下圖。</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="image/catalog/category/catalog-categories.png" alt="look category" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>

<p>圖中的分類資料於安裝時經已預設載入商店中，使用者可以點選分類旁邊的空格或表格頂部的空格把這頁面的全部項目刪除。</p>
<p>The categories above were included with the default products provided by the install. You may delete them to make room for the store&#39;s product categories. To delete, check the box next to the row that the category is listed on. When the products selected for deletion are checked, &quot;Delete&quot; can be clicked on in the upper right corner. This should remove the product categories completely.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> The &quot;&gt;&quot; symbol points from a parent category to a sub-category. &quot;Laptops &amp; Notebooks &gt; Windows&quot; indicates that &quot;Windows&quot; is a sub-category sorted under the parent category &quot;Laptops &amp; Notebooks&quot;.</div>
<p>The Sort Order indicates the order that the categories are displayed in the top menu and category box on the product page. Desktop (sort order-1) will be sorted above Laptops &amp; Notebooks (sort order-2) because it has a higher priority.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Leaving &quot;Sort Order&quot; blank will organize the sections in alphabetical order.</div>
<p>Clicking &quot;Edit&quot; under &quot;Action&quot; will direct the administrator to a form to change the category information. Clicking &quot;Insert&quot; will allow the shop owner to insert more products to the site.</p>
<h2>Create a category</h2>
<p>Before you learn how to add products, you will need to understand how to create product categories. Product category is an essential organizational feature in OpenCart. OpenCart organizes the structure of an online store around these product categories. Every product category gets their own space in the store to display all the available products for that category.</p>
<p>Organizing products into categories is useful for navigating a store&#39;s inventory in both the store front and administration side. In the administration, creating categories for products will help the shop owner keep track of specific products within a category. In the store front, customers will be able to browse their favorite products by category. Category pages can be accessed in the top menu and from the category box in the product page.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><i class="fa  fa-check-circle"></i> Before inserting products into OpenCart, you should take some time to brainstorm and establish categories for your products. Think of how the products in your store can be organized into groups in a logical manner. Generally, you would want to start with creating a broad parent category, and move narrower into specification with each sub-category below it. For example, a broad category such as Electronics is a good parent category. Under the Electronics, a sub-category named &quot;Computers&quot; can be created; and under that category, &quot;Laptops&quot;. You can see how each category becomes more specific as we progress. Putting effort into this task will improve a store&#39;s usability, ultimately bringing customers to other products in the store that may interest them.</div>
<p>Go to Catalog &gt; Category in the administration. If this is your first time in the category section you will see a list of categories created for the default products. You should feel free to delete them to make room for your store&#39;s products. To create a new category for products you can click &quot;Insert&quot; in the upper right corner. You will be directed to the category&#39;s information page. Category information can be filled out under three tabs: &quot;General&quot;, &quot;Data&quot;, &quot;Design&quot;.</p>
