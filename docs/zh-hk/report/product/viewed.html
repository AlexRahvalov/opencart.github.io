<h1>產品報告</h1>

<h2>產品瀏覽報告</h2>
<p>產品瀏覽報告可以讓您了解哪些產品最受歡迎，或者最少受到關注。使用者可以從最底的報告清單中的報告頁面進行檢閱。系統會將產品瀏覽量由高至低排列。除了產品名稱和型號之外，報告還會顯示商店查看該產品的客戶數量以及該網站上所有產品視圖中該特定產品的查看百分比。點擊 <a class="btn btn-danger">重置</a> 將清除以下信息並重置報告以僅從當時收集信息。</p>

<h3>報告分析增加觀點</h3>

<p>From the report above, you can see that the HP LP 3065 is the most viewed product in this store. To increase the views for products in the bottom of the list, you would need to have a good grasp of what type of factors were involved to place that specific product on top. Was this product advertised on other websites? Was the product image included on the product banners on the home page? Were the products added to the related products of a product page? Were they given a special discount price to a customer group through a newsletter? Most likely, the product with the most views will answer &#39;yes&#39; to some of these questions. Typically, the products with the least amount of views will have the least exposure on the site out of all the other products. Of course there may be other factors involved, but the more a product has exposure on the store&#39;s site through links and images, the more views a product will probably get. Take advantage of the back end features of OpenCart to improve the views for the products of a store.

<h2>產品購買報告</h2>
<p>購買報告的產品可以在報告>產品>採購下找到。 報告將顯示從商店購買的所有產品。 產品根據該產品獲得的總金額進行定位：頂部最高，底部最低。</p>

<p>篩選按鈕可讓您自定義列表中顯示的產品。選擇開始日期及結束日期後，系統只會顯示在這兩個日期之間所購買的產品。選擇訂單狀態將顯示在狀態下購買的所有產品，例如待處理或已完成等。</p>
